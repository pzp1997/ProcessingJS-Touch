# ProcessingJS-Touch
#### Enables touch events in [Processing.js](http://processingjs.org)

Just add ``<script type="application/javascript" src="/path/to/touch.js"></script>`` to the bottom of the ``<body>`` in your index.html! Then you can use the variables ``touchX`` and ``touchY`` in your code to get the coordinates of the last touch. Improvements to come (multitouch anyone?).
